# webscraping_for_bing_image
This repository features scripts for practicing web scraping (R and Python) and GUI development (Python). It demonstrates how to scrape data and integrate it into a GUI for comparing scraped images with search terms, aiding in image verification and analysis.

# How to make it work?

Run the following files in order:

1. 1_scrapping_links.R
2. 2_get_image_from_links.py
3. 3_GUI.py
4. 4_image_download.py
5. 5_rectify.py

# Notes
- Alternative libraries for retrieving images from links are available, but I used the chosen one due to installation constraints.

# Future works
- Add requirements
